As with other vaccine-preventable diseases, you are protected best from COVID-19 when you stay up\\nto date with the recommended vaccinations, including recommended boosters.\\nFour COVID-19 vaccines are approved or authorized in the United States:\\nPfizer-BioNTech\\nModerna\\nNovavax\\nJohnson & Johnson’s Janssen (J&J/Janssen) (However, CDC recommends that the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine only be\\nconsidered in certain situations, due to safety concerns.)\\nUpdated (Bivalent) Boosters\\nThe updated (bivalent) boosters are called “bivalent” because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-\\n19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5.\\nPrevious boosters are called “monovalent” because they were designed to protect against the original virus that causes\\nCOVID-19. They also provide some protection against Omicron, but not as much as the updated (bivalent) boosters.\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 has changed over time. The different versions of the virus that have developed over time are\\ncalled variants. Learn more about variants of the COVID-19 virus.\\nTwo COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, have developed updated (bivalent) COVID-19 boosters.\\nWhen Are You Up to Date?\\nYou are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines if you have completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series and received the\\nmost recent booster dose recommended for you by CDC.\\nCOVID-19 vaccine recommendations are based on three things:\\n1. Your age\\n2. The vaccine you first received, and\\n3. The length of time since your last dose\\nPeople who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.\\nYou are still up to date if you receive all COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you and then become ill with COVID-19.\\nYou do not need to be immediately revaccinated or receive an additional booster.\\nBoosters are an important part of protecting yourself from getting seriously ill or dying from\\nCOVID-19. They are recommended for most people.\\nUse this tool to determine when or if you (or your child) can get one or more COVID-19\\nboosters.\\nFind Out When to Get a Booster\\nThis tool is intended to help you make decisions about getting COVID-19 vaccinations. It should not be used to\\ndiagnose or treat COVID-19.\\n\\uf426\\nFind Out When You Can Get Your Booster\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nFor Healthcare Workers: Learn more about COVID-19 vaccine schedules\\n\\uf2ff\\x0c10/23/22, 10:06 AM Stay Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines Including Boosters | CDC\\nGetting Vaccines If You Had or Currently Have COVID-19\\nIf you recently had COVID-19, you may consider delaying your next vaccine dose (whether a primary dose or booster) by 3\\nmonths from when your symptoms started or, if you had no symptoms, when you first received a positive test.\\nReinfection is less likely in the weeks to months after infection. However, certain factors, such as personal risk of severe\\ndisease, or risk of disease in a loved one or close contact, local COVID-19 Community Level, and the most common COVID-19\\nvariant currently causing illness, could be reasons to get a vaccine sooner rather than later.\\nChildren and teens ages 6 months–17 years\\nFor Healthcare Workers: Learn more about COVID 19 vaccine schedules.\\n\\uf2ff\\nCOVID-19 vaccine dosage is based on age on the day of vaccination, not on size or weight.
